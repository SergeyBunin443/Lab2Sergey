    <il>
 <li>Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet

<li> Butter one side of each slice of bread
    <li> Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet
<li> Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area
  <li> Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese
    <li> Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)
    <li> Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)
   <li>. Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese

    <h1>Note:</h1>
        <p>Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.</p>
